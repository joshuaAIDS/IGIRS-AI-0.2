## 🌟 Highlights & Features

### 1. 🪐 3D Liquid Plasma Core & Gyroscopic Tech Rings
- **Native WebGL 3D Core**: Built with custom GLSL shaders with zero heavy external 3D dependencies.
- **Harmonic Fluid Displacement**: Organic multi-octave wave vertex shaders that morph the orb into living liquid energy.
- **Triple Concentric Gyroscopic Rings**: Tilted gimbal rings rotating along independent 3D axes with orbiting satellite nodes.
- **Acoustic Audio Waveform Equator**: A 96-line circular equalizer encircling the orb that erupts into dynamic bouncing audio waveform peaks when speaking.
- **Dynamic State Morphing**: Automatically switches color and animation tempo across states:
  - 🔵 **Standby**: Cyber Blue (`#3a86ff`) with serene celestial rotation.
  - 💠 **Listening**: Electric Cyan (`#00f0ff`) with expanding rings.
  - 🔴 **Thinking**: Flame Neon Rose (`#ff006e`) with high-speed gyroscopic precession.
  - 🟣 **Speaking**: Void Purple (`#8338ec`) with acoustic liquid ripples.

### 2. ⚡ Lightning-Fast Sub-Second Answers (<1s)
- **Tight Token Budgeting**: Capped completion tokens for rapid inference times (~1.0s) via NVIDIA NIM.
- **Direct First-Sentence Answers**: Delivers direct answers immediately in the very first sentence, cutting out robotic throat-clearing and filler preambles.
- **Smart Tool Routing**: Simple conversational chit-chat bypasses the function-calling engine entirely for instantaneous response times.

### 3. 🗣️ Natural Human Companion Voice
- **Neural Voice**: Powered by Microsoft Edge-TTS with `en-US-ChristopherNeural` (natural, confident, conversational JARVIS-like companion).
- **Conversational Pace**: Tuned to `+14%` rate for brisk, natural human pacing.
- **Human Phrasing**: Speaks with natural contractions (*"I'll"*, *"you're"*, *"here's"*, *"it's"*, *"don't"*, *"let's"*).

### 4. 🎙️ Hands-Free "Always Listening" Mode
- Toggle between Push-to-Talk and continuous hands-free voice chat.
- **Voice-Command Stop**: Simply say *"stop listen"*, *"stop listening"*, or *"mute mic"* to immediately exit continuous listening and return to standby.
- **Room Echo Protection**: Intelligent acoustic pause prevents the microphone from catching speaker audio.

### 5. 🎵 Direct YouTube Song Autoplay
- Resolves search queries to direct playable video IDs without requiring heavy official YouTube APIs or browser automation.
- Directly launches `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={videoId}&autoplay=1` so your music starts playing immediately.

### 6. 👁️ Real-Time Screen Vision
- Instant screen grabbing and multi-modal scene analysis via NVIDIA NIM LLaMA-3.2-11B Vision.
- Ask questions like *"What is on my screen?"* or *"Debug this code on my screen"*.

### 7. 📊 Live System Telemetry & HUD Gauges
- Real-time CPU, RAM, and Battery power gauges with plugged-in battery detection.

### 8. 🧠 Persistent Fact Vault Memory
- Remembers user identity, preferences, and facts persistently across restarts in `facts_store.json`.

### 9. 📚 Knowledge Vault & Document RAG (Phase 5)
- Ingest and chat with local PDFs, Word `.docx`, Markdown, text notes, and code files.
- Local high-speed semantic retrieval and citation tracking without uploading files to external clouds.

### 10. 📱 Hands-Free WhatsApp & Email Assistant (Phase 6)
- **WhatsApp Desktop Automation**: Direct hands-free dispatch to contacts and phone numbers with dual-dispatch click & keystroke simulation.
- **Email Intelligence**: Native SMTP/IMAP client with AI email drafting and unread inbox checking.
- **Contacts Manager**: Manage phone numbers, emails, and nicknames directly via voice or GUI.

### 11. 🌐 Web Automation & Live Price Radar (Phase 8)
- **Live E-Commerce Price Radar**: Compares prices live across **Amazon.in** and **Flipkart**, detects best deals, computes savings differences, and provides audio briefings.
- **Smart Web Scraper**: Strips ads and boilerplate to extract clean markdown, data tables, and hyperlinks.
- **Visual Web Capture**: Headless browser webpage screenshot capturing with viewport and full-page support.
